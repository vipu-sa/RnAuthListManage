## Usage

### Folder structure

Follows a very simple project structure:

  - `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside the application.
  - `component`: Folder to store any common component that is used throughout the app.
  - `containers`: Folder to store all the screens/features.
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
  - `App.js`: The main component that starts the whole app.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application as per React-Native standards.
  - `store.js`: Used for the state management Redux
  - `Actions\Reducers`: Used for the state management Redux


### Styleguide

For coding styling, use `StyleSheet` of React-native.

### Components

Components are the basic blocks of a react native application, but since we aim to minimize development complexity, all the components are at the same nesting level.
